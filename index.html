<h1>Micheal Campbell | Portfolio Site</h1>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>As per the title of the site, I am Micheal. I am an Art and Visual Technology major at George Mason University. Ironically, I like writing more than "arting," and so I'm also pursuing an English minor. A majority of the information on this site was taken from <a href="https://mcampb237.wixsite.com/my-site-1">another portfolio site</a> I created using Wix, which was made for AVT 453.</p>

<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>I am a vagabond in the world of art; I wander between whatever comes to my interest, be it drawing, writing, performing, or video making.</p>

<p>I may be a master of none, limited only by my skillset, ambition, and time, but writing is the one calling I can confidently claim to be mine. Although the literary arts may seem antithetical to the optical dependency that the visual realm prescribes, which is an issue further compounded by my own one-track mind, it’s an eternal and universal ability that works harmoniously with anything and all.</p>

<p>I hold a sincere faith that everything I learn and do serves a higher purpose than what I might realize, even when the present moment can’t share the secrets I want to know. Even so, there will always remain room in every aspect of life to improve and grow, a fact that I hope will be made apparent to those who come across what I have available to show.</p>
