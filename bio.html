<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Micheal Campbell is an interdisciplinary artist and writer currently living in Northern Virginia. Appropriate to this location, he has attended Northern Virginia Community College and obtained an Associate’s Degree in the ambitious field of General Studies. During this time, Micheal remained uncertain of his future and what he aspired to do for a career. However, upon applying to George Mason University, he encountered a roadblock which he had been avoiding for as long as possible; it was time to choose a major. Having recently taken an introductory art class at NOVA, he decided on a whim to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Art and Visual Technology, later taking on a minor in English.</p>

<p>A vast majority of Micheal’s completed works have been assignments for his classes that were made when he was still learning and developing his skills. He has at least two self-published short stories available to read on the website Artworks of our Own (AO3), one of which he wrote in under a month’s time that won him bragging rights in a friendly writing competition. Currently, he is focused on finishing his education by the end of 2025 while also slowly chipping away at a grand story that he's been taking his sweet time on.</p>
